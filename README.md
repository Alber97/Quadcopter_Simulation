# Quadcopter_Simulation
Matlab and Simulink files for testing different drone controlers

###
Setting quadcopter parameters in "dron.m"

### 
Tests of control systems for angular positioning in:
- "Dron_pid.slx" (PID controllers)
- "Dron_smc.slx" (SMC controllers)
- "Dron_neuron.slx" (Backstepping controllers with adaptive neural network)

### 
Test of control systems for linear positioning in:
- "Dron_pid_XY.slx" (PI + PID controllers)
- "Dron_smc_XY.slx" (PI + SMC controllers)
- "Dron_neuron_XY.slx" (PI + Backstepping controllers with adaptive neural network)

###
Linear model in "zlinear_pid"

###
Application for chart generating in "wykresy.m"
